            <h2>1. Goals Scored by Players</h2>
            <div id="bar-chart"></div>
            <p>The total goals scored by soccer players are often seen as one of the clearest indicators of their contribution to the team. For instance, Lionel Messi has proven time and again that he is an offensive powerhouse, scoring 35 goals this season. This remarkable feat places him at the top of the goal-scoring leaderboard, showcasing his consistent ability to find the back of the net. Cristiano Ronaldo, while slightly behind with 30 goals, also demonstrates why he’s considered one of the greatest players of all time. His presence on the field is invaluable, and his goal-scoring record speaks volumes about his role in the team's attack. Kylian Mbappé, with 28 goals, is another young talent who continues to shine with his explosive speed and finishing ability. On the other hand, Neymar, despite his immense skill, has scored only 18 goals, a reminder that a player's role in a team is not solely determined by goals but also by other contributions such as assists, dribbling, and playmaking.
                This performance trend is important because it not only reflects individual prowess but also helps to understand how a team’s overall success can hinge on its players' ability to score. The range in goal-scoring figures highlights the different styles and roles players assume on the field. For example, Messi’s playmaking ability often places him in positions where he can both score and assist, while Ronaldo is more of a traditional finisher, making his goal count a direct reflection of his role in the offense.</p>

            <h2>2. Player's Contribution to Team Goals</h2>
            <div id="pie-chart"></div>
            <p>In soccer, the contribution of a player to the team’s total goals is not just a measure of individual performance but also an indicator of their importance within the team structure. For example, Lionel Messi’s 25% contribution to his team’s total goals is a clear sign of how central he is to the team’s offensive strategy. His ability to score and assist in almost every match makes him an indispensable figure in the team’s attack. Similarly, Cristiano Ronaldo’s 22% contribution demonstrates that he is more than just a scorer; he plays a pivotal role in the team’s offensive efforts. Kylian Mbappé and Erling Haaland, with their respective contributions of 20% and 15%, also play crucial roles, showing that while they may not always be the top scorers, their presence in the attacking third is invaluable.

                These numbers also shed light on the dynamics within a team. A player contributing a significant portion of the team’s total goals indicates that the team relies heavily on that individual for success. However, teams that spread the responsibility for scoring across multiple players often have a more versatile and unpredictable attack. Neymar’s 10% contribution, while still important, shows that even star players sometimes share the burden of scoring, allowing others to step up and contribute to the team's success.

            <h2>3. Player Performance Over Time</h2>

            <div id="line-chart"></div>

            <p>The trajectory of a player’s performance throughout a season can be a testament to their resilience and adaptability. Early in the season, many players experience fluctuations in form, with some struggling to adjust to new team dynamics or strategies. For instance, a player might start slow, scoring only one goal in their first match and perhaps two in the next. However, as the season progresses and they settle into their role, we see marked improvement. This player, who initially had trouble finding consistency, goes on to score two goals in subsequent matches and eventually peaks in the final stretch, hitting a high of four goals in their last game.

                This narrative of growth and improvement reflects the nature of professional sports—success often comes from persistence, adaptability, and the ability to learn from earlier struggles. The player’s ability to overcome challenges, whether it's adjusting to new tactics or building chemistry with teammates, becomes evident over time. It also showcases the importance of mental fortitude in sports, as players who can adapt to the ups and downs of a season often come out stronger and more refined.</p>
